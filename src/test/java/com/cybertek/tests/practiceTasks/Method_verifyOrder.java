//PRACTICE #4: Method: verifyOrder•
// Create a method named verifyOrder in SmartBearUtils class.


// Method takes WebDriver object and String(name).
// Method should verify if given name exists in orders.
// This method should simply accepts a name(String), and assert whether given name is in the list or not.
// Create a new TestNG test to test if the method is working as expected
